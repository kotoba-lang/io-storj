  "End-to-end request composition against a recording transport.

  The expected signatures below were produced by an independent implementation
  (Node's `crypto`, driven straight from the SigV4 spec) rather than by this
  library, so they are a real cross-check and not a snapshot of our own output.

  SigV4 itself is covered by `kotoba-lang/sigv4`; what is tested here is the S3
  object surface composed over it.

  JVM-only, because `storj.core/then` is identity-application here and the whole
  pipeline reads synchronously. The ClojureScript/Promise path is covered by
  `scripts/verify-cljs.cljs`."
