;; verify-cljs.cljs — two-runtime parity check.
;;
;; `clojure -M:test` proves the library on the JVM, where `storj.core/then` is
;; identity-application and every crypto call returns a value. That leaves the
;; half that actually ships to browsers and Workers untested: WebCrypto is
;; Promise-based, so the *same* code takes a completely different path through
;; `then`. A green JVM suite says nothing about it.
;;
;; So this script re-runs the client-level assertions — the request and presign
;; signatures cross-checked against an independent implementation in
;; `core_test` — through nbb, on crypto.subtle. Identical expected values,
;; different runtime. If the async composition in `then` were wrong, these
;; would fail while the JVM suite stayed green.
;;
;; SigV4 itself (AWS's published reference vectors, the digests, the encoder)
;; is `kotoba-lang/sigv4`'s to prove, and its CI does — on this same runtime.
;; What is left here is the S3 surface composed over it.
;;
;; The library is a git dep, so nbb needs it on the classpath:
;;
;;   nbb --classpath "$(clojure -Spath)" scripts/verify-cljs.cljs
