(ns storj.store
  "The four functions a content-addressed consumer wants, over a bucket.

  `storj.core` is shaped for S3: keys, ranges, content types, response maps,
  404 as a status rather than a value. A consumer that only wants *bytes by
  reference* has to translate all of that, and every one of them translates it
  slightly differently — which for the 404 case means some of them cannot tell
  `this object is gone` from `this request failed`.

  So the translation is here, once. What comes back is a plain map:

      {:get-object f :put-object f :delete-object f :exists? f}

  and nothing in this namespace names who consumes it. `kotoba-lang/drive`'s
  `drive.object/store-of` takes exactly this shape, and neither library
  depends on the other — whoever builds the store depends on both, and that is
  the application.

  ## A clock has to be handed in

  `storj.core/sign` reads no clock on purpose: a signer that took the time
  from the machine cannot be tested against AWS's own vectors, which are all
  fixed instants. Defaulting to a system clock here would undo that one layer
  up, so `:now` is a required function. It returns an ISO-8601 instant
  (`20130524T000000Z` style, whatever `sign` accepts).

  ## Bytes are a vector of unsigned ints

  Both ways, unconditionally. `storj.core` signs a byte array and returns
  whatever the transport handed it; `drive.object` and every other byte
  handling in this workspace passes vectors of 0-255. Converting at one edge
  rather than at every call site is the point of this namespace — and it is a
  contract rather than a convenience, so a caller who wants the S3 shapes uses
  `storj.core` directly, which is what it is for.

  What that vector *is* comes from `kotoba.bytes`, which is the library the
  word belongs to and had already written this down. This namespace carried
  its own copy for as long as it existed, as did `drive.object`,
  `storj.node.bytes` and `multiformats` — four private answers to a question
  answered in a shared library's README, which is the arrangement where they
  drift and nothing notices. The read direction is now `kotoba.bytes/->bytes`;
  the write direction stays local because it is a host-container question
  (see `->host-body`).

  ## Synchronous on the JVM, thenable on JS

  `storj.core`'s `then` is identity application on `:clj` and `.then` on
  `:cljs`, so these functions return values on a JVM and promises in a
  browser. A consumer whose own interface is synchronous — `drive.object` is,
  because a workspace is a value and its permission checks are pure — can use
  these directly on a JVM and needs its own boundary on JS. Said here rather
  than discovered there."

(defn- ->host-body

  The opposite direction from `kotoba.bytes/->bytes`, and deliberately not
  folded into it: which container is right here is a host question — a JVM
  signer wants `byte[]`, `fetch` wants a `Uint8Array`, Node's fs wants a
  `Buffer` — and a library that answers it centrally would have to pick one
  and be wrong for the others. It was named `->bytes` until `kotoba.bytes`
  gave that name the opposite meaning; two functions with one name pointing
  in two directions is how a workspace ends up converting twice or not at all.

  Strings and existing byte containers pass through: a caller handing this a
  string means a string, and re-encoding one would change what was signed."
