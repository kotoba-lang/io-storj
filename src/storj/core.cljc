  "Signed S3 operations against a Storj Gateway-MT endpoint.

  This namespace never opens a socket, never computes a digest, and no longer
  composes a signature either — `sigv4.request` does that, for every consumer in
  this workspace. What is left here is the Storj object surface: validated
  endpoint policy, the operations, 404-as-nil, and ListObjectsV2 parsing. You
  supply an `ICrypto` (`sigv4.crypto` has a default) and an `IHttp`.

  **One code path, two runtimes.** JVM crypto is synchronous, `crypto.subtle` is
  Promise-based. Rather than fork the signing logic, everything is composed
  through `then`, which is plain application on the JVM and `.then` on JS. The
  consequence for callers: on the JVM these functions return values, on
  ClojureScript they return Promises of the same values — the shape is
  identical, only the wrapper differs. That mirrors `kotoba.lang.ipfs`."
